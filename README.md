OrangeHRM Automation Test Suite
Overview
This project is an automated test suite for the OrangeHRM system, a web-based application for managing employee records, including employee photos, contact details, and HR administration tasks. The test suite is designed to validate key functionalities such as login, forgot password, and PIM (Personal Information Management) module. The project is built using Python, Selenium, and Pytest with a Page Object Model (POM) structure, making it modular and maintainable.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Google Chrome browser installed
ChromeDriver for Selenium (managed by webdriver-manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orangehrm_test.git
cd orangehrm_test
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run tests with Pytest:

bash
Copy code
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
Test Reports:

A detailed HTML report will be generated after test execution. The report can be opened in any browser for review.
Screenshots of each test will be saved in the screenshots/ folder.
Test Scenarios
Login Module
Positive Login Test: Validates successful login with correct credentials.
Negative Login Test: Validates error message with invalid credentials.
Forgot Password Test: Ensures the forgot password link works, displaying a success message after requesting a reset.
Admin Page
Header Validation: Confirms that all expected headers (e.g., User Management, Job, Organization) are visible on the Admin page.
Menu Options Validation: Checks for the presence of all required menu options on the side pane, including Admin, PIM, Leave, and others.
Reports and Screenshots
The test suite generates:

HTML Report: A self-contained HTML file (report.html) with test results.
Screenshots: Stored in the screenshots/ folder, taken at each test step to aid in debugging and result verification.
Project Guidelines
Page Object Model (POM): All web elements and actions are encapsulated within individual page classes in the pages/ folder.
Clean Code: The codebase adheres to PEP 8 standards and best practices for readability and maintainability.
Exception Handling: Python Selenium exceptions are used for robust error handling.
Pytest Report: HTML report generation is configured for easy result analysis.
No sleep() Usage: Explicit waits are used instead of hardcoded delays, improving the test reliability.

To test this OrangeHRM Automation project, follow these steps:

1. Verify Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+, Google Chrome installed, and the ChromeDriver version compatible with your Chrome browser.
Make sure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Configure Environment
Update any necessary credentials in the test files. For example, in the login_page.py, set up your test credentials like the username and password.
If required, update the URL in the test files to point to your specific instance of the OrangeHRM system.
3. Run Tests
From the root directory of the project, use pytest to execute the tests. This command will run all the test cases and generate an HTML report:
bash
Copy code
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
4. Analyze Results
HTML Report: After tests complete, open report.html in a web browser to view detailed results.
Screenshots: Review screenshots stored in the screenshots/ folder to check each test step visually.
5. Debugging Failed Tests
If any tests fail, review the HTML report for error details.
Check the specific screenshots for any failed steps to understand what happened visually.
Use logs or print statements as needed in the test code for further insights.
6. Common Test Commands
Run All Tests:
bash
Copy code
pytest
Run Tests by Keyword:
bash
Copy code
pytest -k "keyword"
This command will only run tests that contain the specified keyword in the test name or description.
Generate HTML Report:
bash
Copy code
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
7. View Test Coverage (Optional)
Install pytest-cov to check code coverage:
bash
Copy code
pip install pytest-cov
Run with coverage:
bash
Copy code
pytest --cov=.
This will show you which parts of your code are covered by tests, helping identify untested parts.
Example: How to Interpret Test Scenarios in Code
Each test file in the tests/ folder contains a set of test scenarios. Here's an example of what each file might include:

test_login.py – includes tests for valid/invalid login attempts and password reset.
test_admin_page.py – includes tests for verifying the Admin page title, headers, and menu options.
8. Add New Tests
To add new test cases, create a new Python file in the tests/ folder, such as test_example.py.
Write test functions following the structure and naming convention:
python
Copy code
def test_example_feature(self):
    # Setup, actions, and assertions go here
By following these steps, you should be able to execute, review, and expand the test cases for the OrangeHRM system efficiently.
